PROMPT = """
You are controlling Vimium to complete user tasks. Follow these steps carefully:

**Current Task**: {prompt}

**Previous Actions**:
{previous_actions}

1. Analyze the screenshot for:
   - Yellow Vimium link hints (priority)
   - Input fields with cursors (indicates focus)
   - Page structure (headers, navigation)
   
2. Action Rules:
   a. If no Vimium hints: click "f" + "Escape", wait 2 seconds
   b. If input focused: type directly (no click needed)
   c. If same action repeated 3x: try "j" (scroll down) then "f"
   d. After navigation: wait 3 seconds before next action
   
3. Response Format:
{{
  "click": "optional key sequence (max 2 keys)",
  "type": "text to type (if input focused)",
  "done": boolean,
  "reason": "detailed explanation including element text/css-selector"
}}
